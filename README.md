This assignment consists of:
- Implementation of web components (custom elements) from code reuse and incapsulation.
- Loading svg assets via <use> tag.
- Running numbers with CountUp.js.
- Scroll animations with AOS (Animation On Scroll).
- Lottie animations via lottie-player and lottie JSONs.

NOTE: In order to load the lottie JSONs properly, run index.html as a live server, otherwise, CORS error is thrown.
You can do it using the VSCode extension "Live Server".
